# Aquarc Sheets

In this repository you will find the source for the notes we have uploaded on our website in addition to some documents we used internally.

Any first person references ("I", "me", "my") refer to [Om Raheja](https://omraheja.me). Unless otherwise stated, I made all the documents in this file. 

This repository is public because I intend for this repository (publicly, at least) to show how I use LaTeX.

# Useful files
These files are also deployed at [aquarc.org/notes](https://aquarc.org/notes). Their source code is **not** included in `aquarc/webstack-v2`. 

- [Series Notes (AP Calculus BC)](https://github.com/aquarc/sheets/blob/main/sets-notes.pdf) [src](https://github.com/aquarc/sheets/blob/main/sets-notes.tex): These notes are an exhaustive list of the serieses used in AP Calculus BC in preparation for the AP test. These are the most detailed as series tends to be the hardest unit for calculus students (at least, in my school).

- [Integration Methods](https://github.com/aquarc/sheets/blob/main/integration-methods-notes.pdf) [src](https://github.com/aquarc/sheets/blob/main/integration-methods-notes.tex): These are methods that explain every type of integral and how to integrate expressions using different methods used in Calculus BC.

- [SAT Math Notes](https://github.com/aquarc/sheets/blob/main/sat-math-notes.pdf) [src](https://github.com/aquarc/sheets/blob/main/sat-math-notes.tex): This is a compilation of concepts I frequently found my peers struggling with for the SAT that are easy to remember once you understand them. 

- [Parametric Notes](https://github.com/aquarc/sheets/blob/main/parametric-notes.pdf) [src](https://github.com/aquarc/sheets/blob/main/parametric-notes.tex): This document explains conceptually how parametrics work. It is not as exhaustive as the notes above but serves as a good reference point.

- [Quick Theorems](https://github.com/aquarc/sheets/blob/main/theorems.pdf) [src](https://github.com/aquarc/sheets/blob/main/theorems.tex): These are theorems that I (and some of my classmates) frequently mixed up. They are organized in one PDF to be easily accessible for the AP test.

- [Min-Max and Inflection Points](https://github.com/aquarc/sheets/blob/main/min-max-inflection.pdf) [src](https://github.com/aquarc/sheets/blob/main/min-max-inflection.tex): These are a quick reference on optimization and how to find the minimum, maximum, and points of inflection using calculus.

- [Logistic Function](https://github.com/aquarc/sheets/blob/main/logistic.pdf) [src](https://github.com/aquarc/sheets/blob/main/logistic.tex): This is a quick reference on the logistic function and what its components in derivative form mean.

# Not as useful

- [Rotating Integrals](https://github.com/aquarc/sheets/blob/main/rotate-integrals.pdf) [src](https://github.com/aquarc/sheets/blob/main/rotate-integrals.tex): This sheet is unfinished but explains conceptually how to rotate an integral about an axis to generate 3d shapes in the different methods required by the Calc BC exam.

- [SAT Math Cheatsheets](https://github.com/aquarc/sheets/blob/main/cheatsheets.pdf) [src](https://github.com/aquarc/sheets/blob/main/cheatsheets.tex): an unfinished cheatsheet that I didn't intend up deploying to the live site for SAT math. This document is by **Jonathan He.**

- [SAT Math Questions & Answers](https://github.com/aquarc/sheets/blob/main/nikil-practice.pdf) [src](https://github.com/aquarc/sheets/blob/main/nikil-practice.tex): These are questions made by [Nikil Pakianathan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikil-pakianathan/) solved by Om Raheja. We didn't end up using them on the website because they were not necessary, but it was a worthwile experiment in how to make hard SAT math questions that we may revisit in the future.

 - [Sample Essay for Language Arts](https://github.com/aquarc/sheets/blob/main/sample-essay.pdf) [src](https://github.com/aquarc/sheets/blob/main/sample-essay.tex): An essay I wrote for my LA 3 Honors class that I planned to use as a demonstration of the structure of essays. The essay isn't the best but I believed this essay to be a decent example of what to do and how to improve essays in general, which Aquarc may revisit (but is less likely to in the near future).

# Aquarc internal documents

- [New Intern Info](https://github.com/aquarc/sheets/blob/main/Prithik-Welcome-Letter.pdf) [src](https://github.com/aquarc/sheets/blob/main/New-Intern-Info.tex): This document provides information to new people working on Aquarc, colloquially referred to as "interns" because they are expected to learn how to work with Aquarc. Very few of them are interested/accountable enough and skilled enough to contribute, so this document is intended to emphasize the kind of people we were looking for when we wanted to expand Aquarc dramatically, which we've learned not to do again.

- [Sample Welcome Letter](https://github.com/aquarc/sheets/blob/main/Prithik-Welcome-Letter.pdf) [src](https://github.com/aquarc/sheets/blob/main/Prithik-Welcome-Letter.tex): A new member once asked me to write a welcome letter. Here's what I wrote.

- `notes/` folder: contains some of my internal notes for Aquarc in markdown.
