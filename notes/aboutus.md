# About us

We are a mission-driven organization seeking to revolutionize education. Right now, we are building an all-in-one platform for high school students encompassing extracurriculars, school, and independent studying. We want to bring this platform to life first. Down the road, we want to build self-paced AI tutors and fight for a more efficient, faster and better public school system. We want to reduce stress, tiredness, and boredom in students.

As of right now, our focus is to make the SAT help, extracurricular finder, and internship newsletter as useful as possible. Once these have matured, we'll move on.
