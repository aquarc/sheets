## how are we going to make a profit
we can apply to grants:
https://cactuscapital.org/ ($50-$100) --> more as VALIDATION, but a really good start
Medici Project ($1k)
https://www.inflectiongrants.com/ ($2k) --> after more research I guess
https://www.mercatus.org/emergent-ventures ($5k) --> probably down the road
https://github.com/nayafia/microgrants --> check these out later
Thiel Fellowship ($100k)

YCombinator (7% for $500k) good network and alumni but not anytime soon lmao

https://libreddit.bus-hit.me/r/buildindia/comments/13q09n0/grants_for_projects_or_startups/--> also really good

### what we need money for if they ask freelancer for infrastructure
what we do with $100

Email Hosting - $40
  - Professional email addresses for inquiries and networking (e.g., no-reply@aquarc.org, hello@aquarc.org, om@aquarc.org).  
  - Covers infrastructure for 1 year.
Store Incentives - $40
  - Reward users 50 cents per "good quality" question in a set.  
  - Small payments for posts promoting Aquarc.
Intern Incentives - $20
  - Motivational tools like stickers for interns. ($10)
  - Gift card giveaways (2 x $5 Amazon gift cards)


#### Elevator pitch
> 60% of high schoolers are stressed everyday.  (every word transcribe thing)

> I'm Om, CEO of Aquarc (flash aquarc and logo on screen). And I'm going to change that.

> At Aquarc, we’re building an all-in-one platform to streamline and enhance the entire high school experience. 
> Right now, we have over 50 subscribers to our internship newsletter, 150+ weekly users of our SAT tool, and a growing public extracurricular database. Right now, our team consists of 10 people.

> But we’re not stopping there. Our goal is to create a super app that includes everything from Q&A forums to study tools—everything a student needs in one place. While we’re already seeing traction, we want to refine our tools more and so we can make high school more streamline and stress free

> Your grant funding will help us make the platform more cohesive, enhance our existing tools, and gather more data to better serve students.

> Thank you so much for considering! (better CTA)

maybe add sound effects

### now, the legal stuff
We have plenty of choice for legal structure, although it's probably better if I research all this after a grant. We don't need to focus on the structure yet, but it'll help us "legalize" unpaid interns or hand out volunteer hours or something. Either way, definitely worth considering down the road.

That being said, here is my research:

#### For profit only
Bad, only can have unpaid labor in form of "unpaid internship" but a lot of companies do this. Would be more akin to "contributing to a GitHub project" because that's all they do.

#### Non profit only
This might also be ok, we get volunteer hours. I can pay myself as "business expenses" not too much though because I'll be kept in check. Might be alright for starting out but hard to earn too much cash or get seed fund investment/other venture capital. Not like I'm going to take a huge chunk of money to pay myself anytime soon, so this might actually be a great legal structure. 

Only downside:
- no seed funding ripre

#### Non profit with a for profit sector
Now we can hand out volunteer hours, keep them at arms length and have a small LLC that returns to shareholders. Plus we get tax-exempt status, just loads of paperwork. On the other hand, we can enjoy profits and pay ourselves a decent salary.

#### L3C (Low profit limited liability company)
a new type of corporation that might be beneficial. Only worth looking at if we decide we need a hybrid for sure.

Also, it is NOT tax-exempt

NOT AVAILABLE IN DELAWARE???

#### next steps
dude, just apply to grants and ask the people who believe in you. lol

### Jurisdiction to incorporate in

#### Texas
Dhanya lives here, one time fee of $300

#### New Jersey
among the worst, but it's my home state

#### Delaware
Under $200 with an incorporator, pretty good I'd say. Have to get a virtual address. Plus good jurisdiction if we run into legal trouble

#### Wyoming
Cheapest I think, bad jurisdiction. Might not be suitable in the long run.

use trello more, show them advanced features

LOGIN FEATURE IS A MUST
- explain my diagram to saketh or samarth, make sure they know what they're doing

once you're logged in you get exclusive access to a page called "study materials" where i'll upload the quadratic and trig cheat sheet etc (advertise it as if ONLY first 100 users get access etc)

should i make yt ivideos or what platform should i use to get more people? linkedin still good? not getting as many views so should i grind linkedin posts?

## What did you learn so far?

Team management is HARD. Soham was kind of right about me being cut out for CEO only. I spend a lot of time making sure the product is working because that's all I know. CEO is the perfect area for where a person has to know a little of everything. I'll have to learn my way into marketing and product refinement and change in execution plans.

When you want someone to join the team, you don't interview them on skills. It's also not as important to emphasize them being an "intern". You have to find their motivators and blockers and help them sort it out then and there and give them an assignment to build up their skills. If they show enough dedication, they are a valid person to hire.

Money is NOT easy to get either. I did apply to a grant, but we barely have a product and we haven't heard back from them neither is our thing good enough to go onto the harder grants. The ideal strategy is to fund it yourself because nobody believes in you until you show them the light. Plus, all your employees are free labor so it's quite hard to move at the pace we need to.

The strategy is to try a bunch of things and see if they work out. YouTube might be the strategy in getting more people in combination with word-of-mouth. I think LinkedIn served its purpose. Whether I should try to milk it further or not is not something I can answer.

## What do you not know

- How effective will the YouTube videos be?
- Should I continue posting on LinkedIn?
- How will I get money?
- What's a reliable pace of development?
- Is this task even accomplishable?

Well, obviously I can't answer those questions, but I can keep the team going and an eye out to pivot in case things slow down.

I was trying to make the team autonomous. It's still a bit slow but it's getting to that point. ## What motivates people
Let's ask more questions from others later though.

1. Dhanya
She cares about her college apps a lot. For aquarc, it might be more related to her ikigai or passion in general. She is willing to work long and hard. I think the extrinsic motivation fuels her there but this one is moreso intrinsic or curiosity.

She really appreciates it when you mention that it would be impossible to make ends meet without her. Everyone likes credit though.

She can work async well and doesn't have to be on a call all the time. But just be a message away in case she needs anything and that sense of "security" is good enough. 

She will do tasks if you ask her to or refuse outright. 

2. Sid
I've worked with Sid for a long time, and it seems like he is willing to do the tedious work if you push him enough but he wants to do stuff on his own. I'm not sure how to keep him instrinsically motivated actually. He says he will do a lot of things but he won't do everything. It probably has to do with both his schoolwork and his homework.

He doesn't like webdev and that's probably a big part of the formula. Leave him to work out the app and he will fix the backend as well. That's what I understand as of now, but I have to ask him more questions.

3. Ronith
Ronith is motivated by work itself. He likes hard work. He says he will do a lot of things and can't always meet his deadlines, but the second he gets a minute free he is very focused. He understands he does more than others. As per Adam's theory, I should be congratulating him more etc because that is equitable. But he doesn't need it that much. Pretty self sufficient guy.

4. Saketh
His college apps make him tick but he was very motivated when he messaged me and wanted to join. Doesn't take on much because he's busy. He has made contributions though so he is ready to try but we can't really say how motivated he is.

Swag impacts him a lot. "I LOVE STICKERS!" Won't work all the time. Seems like it's part of a larger desire to be part of something big. Mix of 3 and 4 on Maslow's hierarchy.

5. Trinabh
He requires a push from time to time but he will do honest work if you ask him to. I don't think he joined the trello yet but it's important to get him started and working. He already does stuff I think in part due to both. He's not very clear as to why he's doing it.

6. Manaswini
She shows up when she can and helps make ends meet sometimes. She says she will do work but ends up being too busy to actually do it. I suppose it'll take a bit of time for me to get to the depths of what she can do.

7. Samarth
He's more of a solo player, wants to have good college apps and be a good UI designer. I don't know how much he cares about the project itself but I'll have to keep pushing him for the time being. However, I don't think this will be effective forever and I'm not sure how well he is gonna perform yet.

Video games! Gamification will work with him

I think you need to let him be on his own and let him cook for a while.

8. Riley
Riley is either dead or doesn't do anything. I have no idea what's going on. 

9. Kheerthan
He works slow but he works with Dhanya. We will find out exactly how motivated he is,

10. Geetesh
and from Dhanya about him as well.

## Questions you can ask to probe at motivation

 What motivated you to join aquarc? Be completely transparent.

 Why do you hop on Sunday meetings and work even though you have so many other commitments?

 What do you like best about aquarc?

 What do you dislike about aquarc?

 What frustrates you?

 What makes you feel valued?

 What was the best experience you ever had? Why was it so good?

 What do you expect from an internship (or working at a company like aquarc)?

 What do you want from your life a year from now? 5 years?

 What kind of music do you like? Does it help you focus?

 What kind of training would you like for your job? (helps understand forward thinking)

 What homework do u need the most help with?

 How do you learn best?


How much experience do you hae?

 When's your birthday?

 Do you want a challenge?

 after thinking so long

 What do you need from me to be your very best?

 How can we be a better team?

 Have them work with Ronith etc.

 Put them into new responsibilities and see if they can handle them.

 On the Maslow's hierarchy needs, everyone is either a 3 or a 4 right now. Most likely at a 4. They want to get to that ligh level.
 Game nights have to be carefully thought out. THere is a lot we can do with them to stick with the theme of aquarc.
 Challenge them actively
 What would you like to learn?

 What skills do you want to use differently at aquarc?

whenever the next meeting is:
-Whenever we have the meeting discuss the about us page
- ask if i should open source my notes
- ask what general blockers everyone has as a group 

Have calls for motivation and ask some of those questions

get a better idea of everyone's thing

# 1-1-2025

screw the previous meeting agenda
leave the floor open to questions about what direction we should take should we try to be all in one etc
talk about my bad manaement etc
help them overcome their own time management etc

really the idea is to help people understand on their own

manaswini was right about me having to be clowned in public

# 1-2-2025

I spend most of my time asking questions - yes.

We decide the "mission statement" and meeting agenda together, all important decisions are debated together and then I make them in public by myself or ask someone else to do them. 

The hard part is deciding what to do with the features. People don't need to "invent" ideas of what people want. Ask them to look deeper into themselves, because they are their own customers. The advantage aquarc has is that our team is also our first user base. I need to sort of teach them to dig deeper and avoid fluff. Three big questions could be?

What's the most difficult part of your life? --> move down the funnel to academics
Do you apply to internships? What did you do the last time you applied? 
Do you think studying is more important to you? What do you do when you study?
Is it messy and hard to organize? How do you try to organize your information?

It'll help my team achieve more independence and think of what they really want to do in the end, what they're really looking for.

Don't give any feature points. Ask what they have trouble with when they're studying or applying to internships and how they would solve it. Then see if that's a worthwhile feature to implement. 

It's also worthwhile to call up businesses to see if they would want to have their internships featured for high schoolers in this manner and see if we can get monetized this way.

At the end, ask them to commit. It'll be hard because it's pretty low stakes for most customers to just sign up and the freemium is free. Don't think through yourself, ask the team. Might not be super necesssary to ask someone to commit at this stage.

SHUT UP, and let the people do the talking.

# 1-3-2024

Organize a meeting a the library? 
Let's decide our big 3 learning goals for each customer conversation... something that puts our entire business on the line.
What exactly do we want to learn?
Walk around with sid and take notes.

We can call up businesses afterwards. Save it for later.

## Concrete Plan 

### Interviews

-  What motivated you to join aquarc? Be completely transparent.
-  Why do you hop on Sunday meetings and work even though you have so many other commitments?
-  What do you like best about aquarc?
-  What do you dislike about aquarc?
-  What frustrates you?

Help them probe at their own blockers

Talk about how my role is fundamentally changing
Make them get Huly beforehand.

### The Big Call

1. Samarth Ghosted, something wrong with how I'm managing so I read books and I realized I was unintentionally micromanaging (5 mins)
- changing focus to improving YOUR career and those who choose to stick around can
- Now I'm going to give you more space and stop forcing you to work on what I want to do.
3. Let's debate on aquarc's mission statement. What actually do we want? Switch em around etc (20 mins)
4. About us page. Rontih shares screen (15 mins)
5. What features do we make --> customer conversations, what they themselves would use. We are both customer and developer so W advantage. Decide on our "three big questions" when asking customers and hit up people at our school (10 mins)
"you guys are smart, you'll figure it out."

Up for a challenge? hit up one person record an audio of you "validating" the product

- changing focus to improving YOUR career and those who choose to stick around can
- Now I'm going to give you more space and stop forcing you to work on what I want to do.
- will message the books i read if u wanna read
2. Let's share our vulnerability so we all understand importance of debate (30 mins)
- Previous experience? Any sports/hobbies? Other fun fact
- One weakness about yourself
- One strength you may have noticed in others(?)

### Interviews

Larger emphasis on help removing their blockers so we can start talking about "commitment" and slowly overcome the dysfunctions.

### Notes

I'll have to see how the week goes spaced out during the interviews as well to decide how to have the "big meeting"

Right afterwards, I'll have to keep an eye out and encourage the following:
- questioning
- conflict
- helping with blockers

A re-read of both texts would probably be ideal. Also constant self-reevaluation

# 1-5-2025

"What are we fighting for?" mission statement question

when waiting forpeople have informal conversation

## Interview

- Why do you hop on Sunday meetings and work even though you have so many other commitments?
- What do you want to see more of at aquarc? Less of?
- What makes you feel valued? * 
- A past working experience --> good, bad, ugly * 
- What do you want from your life a year from now? 5 years? *
- What are you fighting for? *
- What do you want to learn and be challenged by? *
- How can I help you work through other commitments (study sessions?) *
Remote specific questions:
- How do you organize your day-to-day tasks?
- How do you stay motivated when working alone?
- Tell me about a project you took on all by yourself. How did it go?
- How do you limit distractions around you when working?
(Leading from Anywhere)

## Future "Hires"

Make them work with the team and see what feedback the rest of the team gives you. No need to simulate.

## Meeting
rather use Huly? kinda like slack
put meeting agenda beforehand meeting and tell them what to prepare for it

Have separate meetings or breaks. cameras on, mic on, challenge assumptions
break out rooms in pairs

## Notes

Ronith's "inner genius" would be to have meeting notes and keeping himself organized

## meeting notes
should we have merch?
should aquarc have rigid deadlines?
use huly? prompt saketh and small debate
talk about changing roles
mention prithik's friend circle thing

# 1-12-2025

## Meeting
didn't go so well, lots of time wasted. Liked how people kept charge but there's still a lot to be done.

## Qusetions
- what should be done about standups? (a lot said every day was excessive but i think we should personally have good communication of others have questions or to ask what's being done, maybe more Demo Videos or just straight up questions) what's the alternative? (5 mins)
- dashboard features
- should aquarc have rigid deadlines?
- use huly? prompt saketh and small debate after everyone uses it
- talk about changing roles and formalizing them
    - maybe a CTO/CMO form
- three big questions we probe at to ask people features

## Organization
1. each debate has a fixed amount of time
2. chit chat for 10 mins?
3. everyone decides their "project of the week"

## Follow-Ups
- how are your time management skills looking so far?
- what's your Q1 goal?

## Stand-Ups
Focus more on blockers, cut em out for now maybe

## Notes
i have to personally read more into Blue Ocean markets
and The Scrum Guide

stupid to ignore extrinsic

get OBS working
- screens with diagrams like maslow's hierarchy, centralization
- a timer/stopwatch

schd an aquarc meeting with marketing specifically 

4-subteams and each team has a leader that repots progress to me

# 1-17-2025
- seperate gc notes etc

# 1-19-2025
3 deadlines missed: ur kicked from aquarc --> discuss at meeting 

gift card thing

then either
- other end users will receive these questions (with some indicator saying its not made by aquarc) and if let's say 5 ppl say its a good question then it permanently added to our question bank
or
- we manually review cuz if the end user finds bad questions they will stop using aquarc
1 min



# 1-20-2025
lay people off - trinabh

# 1-21-2025
what communication channel is best?

# 1-23-2025
prepguru, satsensei, prepquest, goalguide
- rebrand aquarc? debate topic

# 1-26-2025

- who's interviewing muffadal? kanishka
- when2meet - should it be deployed or not?

maybe give kanishkaa more social work like interviews because she seems to like it
outline a formal interview process --> intentionally make them wait before the interview and add it to the doc

WWw

aquarc mini orgs
cant hqve their own sign up flow --> we effectively own their users
we make an api to interact with ours
aquarc.org subdomain only
maybe ask shrish to do the following

physics
- [ ] sled velocity up when less surface are
- [ ] efficient for oval shaped orbit, like an egg
- [ ] the gravitational pull of jupyter and saturn , sling shot effect 

goal setting questins to consider 
- [ ] speed
- [ ] 90/10
- [ ] is this going to get us the most users?
- [ ] can we do it fast? how fast

sid
- [ ] codeabode thing
- [ ] curric
- [ ] ci/cd
- [ ] call hom

bring back grind calls

intentionally make them wait before interview --> add to doc

why going to china won't hurt my sat
sat 11am

## IMPORTANT
peer to peer accountability --> they still aren't comfortable holding each other accountable yet!! idk how to fix that lol

i think part of the problem is before we had people like satya - not overqualified but willing to do hard work. now we don't have that. in our recruiting process, emphasize that you don'tneed an extensive resume, just a genuine desire to build something better. lowkey we were better when we were humble

# 1-27-2025

- trinabh interested in self startup thingy --> ec finder, research GPT
- i had to prompt ronith to see if he was interested on blog and he eventually straight up said no, that's progress 🔥
- ronith's probably gonna be CTO cuz no other options

## Ronith Notes
doomscrolling, procrastination
articles, wikipedia, news is the new thing, could try RSS for the lack of endless spiral

robotics season done until 9/25

school, end up relearning
for math 1.5 hours go to waste, hard for him, can build on om notes

APUSH --> 20 mins, 10 min classwork 10 min homework, can use deepseek. combined wiht LA takes 2 hours outside of school

finish HW at 9 pm then lock in, sleep at 1 wake up at 7, 6 hrs sleep

starting hard, lofi beats bad
- white noise
- no pomodoro, flow state
- wants to change up workspace
- will try grinding in library
- push ups, standing desk

he wants challenges like the dashboard

manaswini
- lock in school
- weekends ecs
- 3 limiting tasks at a itme
- not too many ecs, js applications and aquarc
- will try probing questions
- will make meeting agenda stuff
- aquarc group of directors

# 1-28-2025

huly? gsheets? github?

should reading up count as volunteer time

# 1-31-2025
- maybe synchronous work was the best thing that happened to aquarc. opening up was useful, but only to meet that end
- discuss the new investment in AI
- discuss purging people
    - company bylaw - can get kicked until u show up again
    - 3 strikes and you're out
    - we should make a formal document outlining this procedure
    - were standups actually helpful?

# 2-1-2025

- have the "board" meetings be more frequent
- use the codeabode approach, build your brand and credibility
    - one on one tutoring
    - use THOSE conversations with paid customers to build more free stuff
    - monetize like that as well
    - prolly will take forever but it's a good strategy
    - Q1 goal, $5 in revenue

- in addition to "visual graphs", the linear regression feature is great
    - just solves equations
    - you can use element lists to do systems of equations
    - nikil: math guide and desmos guide
- english
    - ; is .
    - : is em dash
    - dangling modifiers
    - parallelism


# 2-2-2025
- have the "board" meetings be more frequent
- use the codeabode approach, build your brand and credibility

- who's doing internship newsletter? is it necessary?
- next steps

- people who get removed who want to listen in, what to do about them

# 2-4-2025
all 2-2 things done

oneprep.org anti competitive behavior

# 2-8-2025
we can take oneprep's practice tests and make them timed, piracy good

# 2-15-2025
- geetesh - hackathon??
- i'm going to start doing more tech stuff
- move to tech first

# 2-22-2025
bias to the words in cotnext thing
how much should it be? read about interweaving

# 2-23-2025

hi

i have a few questions i need to ask

aquarc is designing an algorithm

and ur math minded so i wanted to ask for ur help

basically, we want there to be a weight for each category:
Words In Context (Easy): 0.25
Words In Context (Hard): 0.25
Linear Equations (Easy): 0.25
Linear Equations (Hard): 0.25

and each time a person gets a question wrong from a certain category, the weight will change for that category and all others respectively

so i thought there should be two functions to decide how much the weight should change by. for increasing, it should be the upper half of a logistic function like sigmoid because it has an asymptote and we can make it stop arond 0.10 (or some other fixed value, idk i js camse up with that)

ik for the other ones u can just evenly distribute the negative weight change

but how much should that weight change by initially? what should that upper asymptote be? what should the weight change look like if the question is right? what if they get it right and then wrong?

idk how to answer these questions and i'm looking for a direction
14 min

- should a question come up at all if a user is consistently getting them right?
    - do you practice SAT question categories even if they are consistently right? and how frequently?
- should you practice other questions if you're getting one wrong? how frequently?
- what is smoothing if they get it right and then wrong? how would that look?
- with how much increased frequency should a quesiton come up if they randomly get that category wrong?
- should the weight be higher for hard questions?

so to summarize, the end goal from the user’s perspective is that they’re more likely to receive questions in categories for which they answer incorrectly?

throwie72
:
precisely
[

throwie72
:
and if they get the question right then it shows up less
[
5:50 PM
]
ScalarField
:
The simplest system that I can think of that never completely eliminates a question type is this:
If the user gets a question in some category right, decrease its weight to 3/4 of what it used to be and re-distribute that loss to the other categories. If they get a question wrong, increase its weight to 4/3 of what it used to be and detract from all the other categories equally, to exactly undo what happens if you got it wrong just now. The choice of 3/4 specifically could be adjusted for balance as needed.
[
5:51 PM

throwie72
:
that would make sense but shouldn't there be an upper asymptote
[
5:51 PM
]
throwie72
:
actually i'm not sure
[
5:51 PM
]
throwie72
:
i believe interweaving is an effective learning method so there should be an upper bound
[
5:52 PM
]
ScalarField
:
Upper asymptote for what quantity
[
5:53 PM
]
throwie72
:
like say someone just sucks at geometry hard questions completely, they should still get other types of questions because geometry isn't the only thing on the test and we should keep checking for other problems the user has answering other questions
[
5:54 PM
]
throwie72
:
again i'm not an educator so i'm not sure

so if we increase 1 weight do we also subtract from the other weights
Ahora

yeah

but that's like a fixed amount

if we increase by 0.005 then we divide and subtract across the others

# 3-12-2025

basically we need to get feedback and ask ourselves what we really use to get features done going forward

stuff like focused quizzes is useless for example unless the UI is somehow cleaner but then we gotta adjust the main UI anyway

we gotta figure out how the diagnstic test would work too

i think the fact that we are thinking about all these things now is great because it goes to show how much more finished we are than when we started
18 min

- have a question help interface where nikil helps out ig
- time per question?

i feel like u gotta design the features first and layout later u might not need a whole dashboard just a little sidebar to piggyback on the tool idk

3. mimick bluebook a bit more ig * om

- new selection UI with less collapsibles and shit
    - unselect section
    - All choice
- timer stopwatch pomodoro mode (wait on ronith), stop when answer clicked
- shuffle button
- adaptive button (use the algorithm u designed)
- mark for review

- additional info left right (?)
- NAH: unselect if you select an answer
- NAH: move timer down there cuz peole don't know it is a button (?)
- NAH: select question choice (mitigated by the "sesion" feature ig)
4. GPT wrapper (fr, it'll help people decipher what exactly is wrong for now?)
5. let's outline a lean canvas during the meeting
6. dictionary and streaks??
7. color scheme (pastel colors)
- consistent button theme

# 3-15-2025
notice the stylistically interesting questions
and we should have an import score report functionality

# 3-19-2025
avg time per question metric under the stopwatch
